# Overview

**WeatherApp** is a mobile application that offers information about the weather at the current time, the weather of each hour for the next 24 hours and the weather of the next days.

After you install the app, you should have an internet conenction and for the first time you should activate the location on your phone and accept the location permission that it will ask from you, otherwise the application will repeatedly ask for those informations.
Once the application shows the weather you can desactivate the location on your phone and for that, as long as you don't activite the location and you don't restart the application, you will have the weather of the same location.

The application is multi-language (English - Arabic - French) and multi-unites (°C or °F or K, Meter/Sec or Miles/Hour, 24h or 12h)

For the location info I used the **LocationIQ** api.
